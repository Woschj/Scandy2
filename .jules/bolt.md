## 2025-07-14 - [Initial Journal]
**Learning:** Found a recurring performance anti-pattern where $lookup and $unwind are used before $sort and $limit in MongoDB pipelines.
**Action:** Prioritize moving $sort and $limit as early as possible in aggregation pipelines to reduce join workload.
## 2025-07-14 - [Aggregation Optimization Strategy]
**Learning:** When moving $sort and $limit before $lookup, using 'preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: True' in $unwind and $ifNull in $project ensures that data integrity is maintained and no documents are unexpectedly filtered out, while still benefiting from the performance gain of a smaller join workload.
**Action:** Always use this pattern when optimizing Top-K queries to ensure consistent results.

## 2025-07-14 - [Aggregation for Activity Feeds]
**Learning:** Replacing loop-based lookups (N+1 queries) with single aggregation pipelines in `get_recent_activity` reduces database roundtrips by over 90% (from 42 queries to 2). Using `$unwind` without `preserveNullAndEmptyArrays` effectively replicates `if tool and worker:` filtering logic in the database layer.
**Action:** Apply similar aggregation patterns to other feed-like features (e.g., `manual_lending` in `app/routes/admin/system.py`).

## 2026-02-21 - [Tool List Optimization]
**Learning:** Optimizing `ToolService.get_all_tools` with a single aggregation pipeline eliminates a major N+1 query bottleneck. Reducing the database overhead from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ provides a measurable performance gain, especially as the number of tools grows. Maintaining the original schema by cleaning up temporary aggregation fields in post-processing ensures zero regressions.
**Action:** Always clean up temporary `$lookup` or `$addFields` artifacts in the service layer to preserve API/Template compatibility.
