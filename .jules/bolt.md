**Learning:** Found a recurring performance anti-pattern where $lookup and $unwind are used before $sort and $limit in MongoDB pipelines.
**Action:** Prioritize moving $sort and $limit as early as possible in aggregation pipelines to reduce join workload.
## 2025-07-14 - [Aggregation Optimization Strategy]
**Learning:** When moving $sort and $limit before $lookup, using 'preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: True' in $unwind and $ifNull in $project ensures that data integrity is maintained and no documents are unexpectedly filtered out, while still benefiting from the performance gain of a smaller join workload.
**Action:** Always use this pattern when optimizing Top-K queries to ensure consistent results.
